### ðŸŒŸ Why STL?

We learned about the creation of many STL components behind the scenes. In competitive programming (CP), we often need to access STL frequently rather than create our own, which is why **STL is helpful for accessing functionalities**. We were taught the basics in the main course.

### ðŸ”¹ What is STL?

**STL** stands for **Standard Template Library**. STL is built using three main components:

1. **Containers:** Used to store collections of data. Common examples include:
   - **Vector**
   - **String**
   - **Map**
   - **Stack**
   - **Queue**
2. **Algorithms/Functions:** Predefined methods that make data manipulation easier:
   - `push_back()`
   - `sort()`
   - `reverse()`
   - `find()`
3. **Iterators:** used to access elements in containers that arenâ€™t array-like
   - **Map**
   - **Set**
