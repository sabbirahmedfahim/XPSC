### 🚀 Understanding the Deque: More Than Just a Vector!

The deque (double-ended queue) offers nearly all the functionality of a vector but with additional flexibility. One minor downside is that **it requires more memory due to its need to maintain two pointers**.📌

In a broader sense, a deque can replace a stack, queue, linked list, and vector at the same time. Here’s why:
- 🚀 push_front() - O(1)
- 🚀 push_back()  - O(1)
- 🚀 pop_front()  - O(1)
- 🚀 pop_back()   - O(1)

### 🌟 Key Benefits
- 🔗 Array-like Access: Deque allows both index-based access and iterators.
- 📈 Dynamic Size: It grows as needed, removing the need for manual resizing.

❗ Note: It is recommended to use Vector for normal operations because deque is not memory efficient.
