## Fixed Size Sliding Window vs Variable Size Sliding Window

| Concept                 | Fixed Size Sliding Window                                                            | Variable Size Sliding Window                                                            |

| **Definition**          | Predefined window size slides over the array to find results.                        | Window size varies based on conditions like finding the longest or shortest subarray.   |
| **Usage**               | Operate on a given segment length.                                                   | Adjust window size dynamically based on conditions (e.g., longest or shortest segment). |
| **In Short**            | Fixed segment size; operations within that window.                                   | Window size adapts to given conditions for optimal segment length.                      |
| **Building the Answer** | Use fixed window size to check conditions.                                           | Adjust window size to meet specific conditions (e.g., minimum length subarray).         |
