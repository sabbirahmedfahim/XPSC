# GCD & LCM Notes 📌

```md
## GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) ✂️
- The **GCD** of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.
- It can be found using **prime factorization** or the **Euclidean algorithm**.

### Example:
```plaintext
x = 18 → Prime factors: 2, 3, 3
y = 24 → Prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 3
Common prime factors: 2^1, 3^1
GCD = 2 × 3 = 6 🎯
```

## LCM (Least Common Multiple) 🔢
- The **LCM** of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.
- It considers the **largest power** of each prime factor.

### Example:
```plaintext
x = 18 → Prime factors: 2, 3, 3
y = 24 → Prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 3
LCM Calculation:
  - Highest power of 2 = 2³
  - Highest power of 3 = 3²
  - LCM = 2³ × 3² = 8 × 9 = 72 ✅
```

- If a prime factor is missing in one number, we assume its power is **zero** (e.g., 2⁰ = 1). 🧐
