**Goldbach's conjecture** is one of the oldest and best-known **unsolved problems** in **number theory** and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

Unsolved problem because it works but it has no proofs. Interesting. 

For example, <br>
26 => 13 + 13 <br>
20 => 7 + 13 <br>
10 => 3 + 7 Or 5 + 5
